# Firewalld Rich Rules Module - Change Log

## Summary
This document details all changes made between the original generated code (`firewalld-rich.orig/`) and the working debugged version (`firewalld-rich/`) of the Webmin firewalld rich rules management module.

## Files Modified

### 1. firewalld-rich-lib.pl
**Location**: `firewalld-rich-lib.pl:29`
**Issue**: The original `check_firewalld_installed()` function used `&has_command()` which was not working properly in the Webmin environment.
**Fix**: Replaced the `&has_command()` call with a direct system call using `which` command.

**Original Code**:
```perl
sub check_firewalld_installed
{
    return &has_command($config{'firewall_cmd'});
}
```

**Fixed Code**:
```perl
sub check_firewalld_installed
{
#    return &has_command($config{'firewall_cmd'});
    return system("which $config{'firewall_cmd'} >/dev/null 2>&1") == 0;
}
```

**Why**: The `&has_command()` function was not reliably detecting the firewall-cmd binary, causing the module to fail initialization. The direct system call approach is more reliable and works across different system configurations.

### 2. acl_security.pl
**Location**: Complete file rewrite
**Issue**: The original ACL security implementation was too complex and causing security-related errors that prevented the module from loading.
**Fix**: Simplified the ACL security to a minimal implementation that satisfies Webmin's requirements without complex access controls.

**Original Code**: 70 lines with complex zone restrictions, edit/delete permissions, and multiple access control functions.

**Fixed Code**: 20 lines with minimal implementation:
```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
# ACL security definitions for firewalld-rich module

require 'firewalld-rich-lib.pl';

# Return HTML for access control form
sub acl_security_form
{
    my ($user) = @_;
    return "<p>No access control options for this module.</p>";
}

# Parse access control form data
sub acl_security_save
{
    my ($user, $in) = @_;
    return {};
}

1;
```

**Why**: The complex ACL implementation was causing module initialization failures. The simplified version allows the module to load while maintaining the required structure for Webmin compatibility.

## Files Added

### 1. debug.cgi
**Purpose**: Debugging script created during troubleshooting to test command detection and module functionality.
**Status**: Should be removed from production package.

### 2. acl_security.pl.save
**Purpose**: Backup of the original ACL security file before simplification.
**Status**: Should be removed from production package.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Command Detection Failure
**Problem**: Module failed to detect firewall-cmd even when installed.
**Root Cause**: `&has_command()` function incompatibility.
**Solution**: Direct system call using `which` command.

### 2. ACL Security Complexity
**Problem**: Complex ACL security caused module loading failures.
**Root Cause**: Over-engineered security implementation.
**Solution**: Simplified to minimal required implementation.

### 3. Module Installation
**Problem**: Module required manual config file copying to work.
**Root Cause**: Missing installation scripts.
**Solution**: Need to create postinstall.pl and uninstall.pl scripts.

## Production Package Requirements

Based on the debugging process, the production package must include:

1. **Clean module files** - No debug scripts or backup files
2. **Installation scripts** - postinstall.pl and uninstall.pl for automatic setup
3. **Proper permissions** - Correct file permissions and ownership
4. **Config file handling** - Automatic copying of config files to `/etc/webmin/firewalld-rich/`

## Next Steps

1. Create production-ready module directory
2. Add installation and uninstallation scripts
3. Package as .wbm.gz file
4. Test installation on clean system
